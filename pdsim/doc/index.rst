   changelog
    
PDSim is a software package developed to enable quasi-steady simulation of positive displacement compressors and expanders.  

It was written in Python by Ian Bell with assistance from Davide Ziviani and Craig Bradshaw.  Development is ongoing, particularly of functionality for scroll compressors and expanders.

Windows users can download a graphical user interface by going here: `PDSim GUI <https://sourceforge.net/projects/pdsim/files/>`_
    
PDSim is an open-source project and welcomes the assistance of other researchers, developers, or anyone generally interested in compressors.
